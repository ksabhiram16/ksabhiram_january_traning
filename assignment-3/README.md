# Linear Regression Assignment

## Dataset
Source: Kaggle Housing Price Dataset  
Rows: 1000+  
Target Variable: price

## Steps Followed
1. Data Cleaning (Handled missing values, encoded categories)
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (Visualized relationships, checked correlations)
3. Train-Test Split (70% training, 30% testing)
4. Built Linear Regression Model
5. Evaluated using MSE and R² Score

## Model Performance
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): XXXX
- R² Score: XXXX

## Interpretation
Key features affecting price:
- Area
- Bedrooms
- Bathrooms

Higher coefficient = stronger impact on price.

## Conclusion
The Linear Regression model performs well with good prediction accuracy.
